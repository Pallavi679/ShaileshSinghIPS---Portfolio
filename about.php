                       The opportunity to help people in distress was my main motivation. To prevent commission of offences, maintain peace and order in society and the unique identity given by the uniform were among the reasons to join the Indian Police Service. Police are those people to whom the common man comes when he has been wronged. The men in uniform help such people achieve justice.
